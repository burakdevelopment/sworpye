# Sworpye Crypter Version - 1.0

This crypter obfuscate program encrypts software codes by obfuscating them to make them harder to analyze and reverse engineer. The program makes the source codes unreadable thus preventing malicious people from intervening while preserving the original logic of the software. It both increases security and protects the software.

## Features

- XOR Encryption: Encrypts data using the XOR operation ensuring that each bit is replaced with a specific key, making the encrypted data unintelligible.
- Base64 Encryption: By encrypting data in Base64 format it eliminates the readability of the data and ensures that files are transported more securely.
- String Junk Code: Adds unnecessary lines of code making the software harder to analyze and hindering reverse engineering processes.

- ## Purpose

- This program uses XOR encryption, Base64 encryption, and string junk code techniques to increase the security of the software. These methods prevent the readability of the code and make it difficult for malicious people to reverse engineer the internal logic of the software. As a result, it ensures the protection of the software and increases its security.

- ## How to use? (Linux OS)

- git clone https://github.com/burakdevelopment/sworpye/
- cd sworpye
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python packer.py
- Created succesfully final_stub.py!
- Now you can make it an .exe with the command 'pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole final_stub.py'

- ## How to use? (Windows OS)

- Download the .zip file of this repositorie.
- Extract the .zip file wherever you want.
- Win + R and open CMD.
- Wherever you extracted the folder enter that folder and directory with the cd command. All you need to do is get into the folder.
- Once inside the folder:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python packer.py
- After the all process will create final_stub.py succesfully!
- Now you can make it an .exe with the command 'pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole final_stub.py'

# !!!WARNING!!!
- ## All liability arising from misuse of the program belongs to the user and those who use it are deemed to have accepted this!

- Your opinions are important to me :)
